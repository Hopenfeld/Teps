Pattern Search Based Multi-Channel QRS detector

The QRS detector searches for peak patterns consistent with human sinus rhythm; this constraint greatly improves the detection capability in the context of sinus rhythm.  The detector performs initial broad based peak detection and then performs a search within the highest probabillity peak set to generate a number of candidate QRS sequences.  These sequences are scored according to: the number of missed beats in the sequence, the temporal regularity of the sequence, and a relative signal to noise measure based on the ratio of (second difference) peak magnitudes of within sequence peaks to other peaks.  Specifically, this ratio is calculated for each peak pair within a sequence, whose magnitudes are compared with the peaks between the pair.  Multi-channel fusion is performed by finding peaks that temporally align across channels, and scoring the peaks in Bayesian fashion according to temporal alignment and peak prominence; the highest probability peaks form the highest probability peak set from which sequences are generated.
